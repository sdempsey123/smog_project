This project covers a website that can work with most smog-check businesses in the state of California. I built this website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I made it just a one-page website utilizing different colors and different fonts throughout the project. Also, instead of doing multiple pages, I have links that set up a vertical scroll with links.

## Making a promise

Like other smog check outlets, this one promises that it will pass the DMV smog check or drivers will get a free test after making the proper fixes.

## Getting the best deal

This coupon gives drivers a break. Yes, drivers dread opening up their DMV registration notice only to find out they have to get their car "smogged," better known as a DMV smog check. To help these drivers, this business is offering a coupon that can last as long as this business stays open.

This is where users can find the location of the smog shop, hours of business, and what credit cards are accepted. The credit cards are a mere graphic and not an actual link due to security reasons. Once this becomes live, links will be added.
