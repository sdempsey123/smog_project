This project covers a website that can work with most smog-check businesses in the state of California. I built this website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I made it just a one-page website utilizing different colors and different fonts throughout the project. Also, instead of doing multiple pages, I have links that set up a vertical scroll with links.

## Making a promise


Like other smog check outlets, this one promises that it will pass the DMV smog check or drivers will get a free test after making the proper fixes.
